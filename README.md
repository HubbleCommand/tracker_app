# ARCHIVED
I am archiving this repo as the main feature I wanted to do, activity cropping & editing, is actually a free feature in Strava.
I was originally under the impression that [this feature](https://www.strava.com/activities/10353132047/truncate) was a paid feature.
I don't believe in doing something that's already been done, so I am nuking this into oblivion.
It was an interesting foray into Flutter after having not used it for so long, and it has really improved.
The tracking part works without issue with the associated file I/O, however I am not finishing the rest.

# CLI Script

To upload the activities I have already recorded, I am writing a short Python script to convert them into the appropriate format that Strava accepts.


# Tracker App
Simple location tracker app. 

Allows editing tracks.

## TODO
- Edit Tracks
  - Path
  - Split
  - Merge (?)
- Strava integration
  - Download / upload / patch activities
- Info graphs (already in Strava)
  - Height
  - Speed
